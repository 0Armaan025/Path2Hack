React applications are built using components, which are reusable UI blocks. Most commonly, these are created as functional components, although class components can also be used. Components become flexible with props, a feature that lets you pass data from parent components to their children. For managing dynamic data within a component, React provides state, commonly managed with the useState hook. User interactions like clicks can be managed using event handlers, while conditional rendering allows you to display different UI elements based on specific conditions. When dealing with lists of items, React requires you to assign unique keys to each list item for efficient re-rendering. For applications with multiple pages, react-router-dom provides seamless navigation, and for handling side effects like data fetching or timers, the useEffect hook is available in functional components. These basics form the foundation of React and are essential for building responsive, single-page applications.`

Users can add tasks to the "To Do" column using an input field, and tasks can be moved between columns by clicking on them, with JavaScript handling task creation and movement. CSS is used to style the board, columns, and tasks, making it visually interactive. The functionality can be enhanced by adding persistence with localStorage, task removal options, task editing, or implementing drag-and-drop features for a more robust Kanban board.`

For full-stack applications, platforms like Heroku or cloud providers like AWS require more configuration but provide greater flexibility.

Data fetching methods like getStaticProps and getServerSideProps make it easy to pull in data, while dynamic routing allows creating pages with variable paths. You can also create API routes within the pages/api directory to build serverless functions. Next.js supports various styling options, including CSS modules, global CSS, and Styled JSX. Use the built-in Image component for optimized, responsive images. Deployment is seamless on platforms like Vercel, which is ideal for Next.js projects.
