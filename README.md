## For Hackers, By Hackers, To Hackers

<br/>

### This website helps users know about hackathons, how to ace them, how to find teammates, gives a proper workflow, has a dashboard to track projects, can view others' projects for inspiration, can analyze your github repos by username and generate idea using Gemini API, so you will never run out of ideas! ;)

<br/>

### This is the whole idea and we made 90% of the app in the hackathon yesterday, and since it just ended, it's Phase 1.) which is kinda incompleted like everything works, but not attached.

<br/>

### How to test it yourself?

<br/>

``1.) git clone https://github.com/0Armaan025/Path2Hack``

<br/>

``2.) cd into the folder``

<br/>

``3.) npm install, and make a file called .env.local and add auth0 endpoints``

<br/>

``4.) npm run dev``

<br/>

### Then, open another terminal:

<br/>

1.) ``git clone https://github.com/0Armaan025/Path2Hack-api``

<br/>

2.) cd into the folder

<br/>

3.) ``node install, and create a file called .env.local and add MONGODB_URI and GEMINI_API_KEY``

<br/>

4.) ``npm start to start it``

<br/>

### boom, it works on localhost:3000

<br/>

### Thanks :)

## Make sure to leave a ‚≠ê please, it's under construction tho, Thanks :)
